    <h3>miRNA quantifications for the European population samples.</h3>

    miRNA quantifications for analysis were calculated as read counts
    using miRBase database annotations as the reference. Reads that
    mapped equally well to two or more miRNAs are counted fully towards
    each miRNA. All read count quantifications were corrected for
    variation in sequencing depth between samples by normalizing
    the reads to the median number of miRNA reads (1.2M). <br><br>

    Track shows the population minimum, average and maximum values of
    miRNA quantification. By clicking on the element of interest it
    is possible view information about each element: description,
    scoring information and links to other relevant data sources,
    for instance Ensembl Genome Browser.<br><br>
