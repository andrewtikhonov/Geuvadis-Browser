    <h3>Transcript quantifications for the European population samples.</h3>
    Quantifications of transcripts are based on the annotation­‐mapped
    genomic mappings considering transcript structures of the Gencode
    transcriptome annotation. Reads belonging to single transcripts
    were predicted by deconvolution according to observations of paired
    reads mapping across all exonic segments of a locus. All read
    count quantifications were corrected for variation in sequencing
    depth between samples by normalizing the reads to the median number
    of well-­mapped reads (45M); filtered by removal of quantification
    units with >50% of missing data across the entire data set,
    corrected of 10 number of factors
    in <a href="https://github.com/PMBio/peer/wiki">PEER</a> and forcing
    the residuals from PEER to standard normal. <br><br>

    Track shows the population minimum, average and maximum values of
    transcript quantification. By clicking on the element of interest
    it is possible view information about each element: description,
