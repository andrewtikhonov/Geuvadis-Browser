    <h3>Exon expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for the European population samples.</h3>

    Exon eQTLs in cis were calculated in a sample set of 373 Europeans by linear regression of genetic
    variants with >5% frequency in 1MB window from TSS and normalized exon quantifications. Only
    significant associations (5% FDR) are shown.<br><br>

    The bars represent genetic variants, with the height of the bar showing the p-value of eQTL
    association. The best variant of each gene is shown in grey. Details of each association can
    be seen by clicking the variant, and clicking on an associating exon on this will move the
    quantification track to the region of the exon.<br><br>
