    <h3>Exon quantifications for the Yoruba population samples.</h3>
    Exon quantifications were calculated for protein-coding and linc-RNA transcripts.
    All overlapping exons of a gene were merged into meta-exons. Read counts over these
    elements were calculated without using information of read pairing, except for
    excluding reads where the pairs map to two different genes. We counted a read in
    an exon if either its start or end coordinate overlapped an exon. For split reads,
    we counted the exon overlap of each split fragment, and added counts per read
    as 1/(number of overlapping exons per gene).<br><br>

    Track shows the population minimum, average and maximum values of exon counts.
    By clicking on the element of interest it is possible view information about each
    element: description, scoring information and links to other relevant data sources,
    for instance Ensembl Genome Browser.<br><br>
