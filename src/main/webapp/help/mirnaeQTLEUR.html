    <h3>miRNA eQTL for the European population samples.</h3>

    mirQTLs were calculated by mapping cis-mirQTLs to various transcriptome
    traits using linear regression separately in the European (EUR) and
    Yoruba (YRI) populations using genetic variants with >5% frequency in
    1MB window and normalized miRNA quantifications. Permutations were used
    to adjust FDR to 5%<br><br>

    Track shows SNPs and indels associated with functional effects. By clicking
    on the element of interest will provide additional information including
    all linked effect elements associated with mirQTL along with related p-values.
    The mirQTL track is linked to miRNA quantification track so by choosing
    the miRNA from the list of associations the quantification track window
    slides to the appropriate region. <br><br>
