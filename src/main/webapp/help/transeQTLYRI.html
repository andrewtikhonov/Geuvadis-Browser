    <h3>Transcript ratio quantitative trait loci (trQTL) for the Yoruba population samples.</h3>

    For the transcript ratio QTLs (trQTLs), we sought to characterize
    the QTL effect on transcript usage. For each trQTL gene, we identified
    the transcript with highest association and the transcript with
    most negatively correlated quantifications to this. Given the
    annotation of these two transcripts we classified the events for
    each trQTL.<br><br>

    Track shows SNPs and indels associated with functional effects.
    By clicking on the element of interest will provide additional information
    including all linked effect elements associated with eQTL along
    with related p-Â­values. The trQTL track is linked to transcript
    quantification track so by choosing the transcript from the list
    of associations the quantification track window slides to the
    appropriate region. <br><br>
