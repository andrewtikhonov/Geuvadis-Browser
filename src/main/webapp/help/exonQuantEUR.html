    <h3>Exon quantifications for the European population samples.</h3>

    Exon quantifications were calculated for protein-coding and linc‐RNA transcripts
    of Gencode v12 annotation. All overlapping exons of a gene were merged into meta-exons.
    Read counts over these elements were calculated without using information of
    read pairing, except for excluding reads where the pairs map to two different genes,
    and a read was counted in an exon if either its start or end coordinate overlapped
    an exon. For split reads, we counted the exon overlap of each split fragment, and added
    counts per read as 1/(number of overlapping exons per gene). The track shows the
    population minimum, average and maximum values of exon counts.<br><br>
