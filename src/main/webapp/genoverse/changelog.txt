js/Genoverse.js

* container can be a string now (jQuery style)
+ load plugins function (in a deferred way)
* class .canvas_container is added to container automatically
* labelWidth is removed (commented out for now) - moved to CSS
* menuContainer was causing lots of problems, so menus are rendered in container for now
+ closeMenus function
+ tracksById hash
* makeMenu doesn't require track now (for general popups, like tracks selection), also order of arguments changed



js/Track.js

+ xhrFields hash for cross-origin requests that require credentials
* $.extend in the constructor is making deepcopy (to avoid different tracks sharing nested settings)
+ construction of the DOM elements for the track is moved to a separate function .addDomElements(config)
+ 'hidden' setting for the track (hides the track, while keeping it rendered and ready to show)
+ .show() and .hide() functions for 'hidden' setting



css/genoverse.css

- main css file is cleared of control panel stuff (it has been moved to the controlPanel plugin css)
+ labels width is added (moved from js config to CSS)


Plugins:

* plugins can now be specified in the main config as array
* css moved from plugin javascript to separate css files and LazyLoaded

DAS tracks

js/Track/DAS/Band.js
Track type renamed from DASBand to DAS.Band


* general cleanup (lots of old code moved to 'old' folders)


js/beta.js

All genoverse code combined and wrapped in a function to avoid jQuery conflicts for 3rd party users
Config can be placed now inside tag of the script


Couple of examples of how it could be integrated into the page:

example.html - all js files included separately, genoverse instantiated explicitly
index.html - one combined js file, config placed inside the script tag
